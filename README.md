Idiosyncrasy plays with the enigma of self-identity and
personality in an impish remix of mechanical fortune
tellers and classic artist’s games. Choose your
answers wisely...

Can we really pin down a person’s identity and
expose their inner-self by answering a few questions?
In Idiosyncrasy, a randomized mashup of questions
inspired by horoscopes, professional aptitude tests,
Buzzfeed quizzes, online dating questionnaires, and
other personality tests is paired with the surrealist
artist’s game of Exquisite-Corpse—a game where
segments of images are blindly mixed together to
create a collaged image. The player is given the
introspective opportunity to select answers that
best represent them, resulting in a collaborative
take away art-piece.

The questions are pulled from a bank of 8 categories
that range from serious to silly. A hidden score has
been assigned to each answer; the score the player
gets in each category will determine which different
drawings are collaged together to create the final art
piece. With thousands of possible permutations, each
play of the game can ask different questions and
result in unique art pieces.
